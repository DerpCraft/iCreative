iCreative is an interactive solution for monitoring and controling the Vanilla Creative GameMode.

By careful monitoring of server events, iCreative allows any server admin to limit the abilities of the Creative GameMode so as to reduce the posibility of the gamemode being abused by users on any server.

Below is a list of what iCreative moniters and controls:
 * Inventories
 * Block Placement
 * Block Breaking
 * Block Interaction
 * Entity Interaction
 * Player Interaction
 * Flight
